### What is this? 
This is the reference environment for the manuscript 'Hierarchical Bond Graph Modelling of Biochemical Networks'
[Here is the project page](http://uomsystemsbiology.github.io/hbgm/)

### Where is the publication?
[Here is the arXiv link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01814)

### How do I see the results and work with the code?
First install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/hbgm_reference_environment.git
$ cd hbgm_reference_environment
$ vagrant up
```
This will get the code for this project and build a virtual environment with scripts you can run to reproduce the computations and figures in the publication.
